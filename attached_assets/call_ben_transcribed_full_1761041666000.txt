Josh
Yo...

Ben
Hey man

Josh
Hows it going

Ben
Just put the car just to make sure everything's good before I put it on the dino and ah, that prop shaft is no good. It's the bearings are gone.

Josh
Wow, really...

Ben
Yeah, just because it's like disturbing it, if it's on its last leg, then you just like you just move it a little bit. and the bearings just fall essentially into that chamber and then they, just you can't, it's non serviceable. So... it definitely needs to be fixed. You don't want to know how much a prop  shaft is. They're ridiculous. So I'm just about to ring up as a prop shaft place like a drive shaft place up in Kunda Park and it will probably be half the price to get them to do it where they Weld it up and do it at properly like a serviceable part. So that if if the bearings ever go again in the future of having it, you can just replace the bearings rather than replace the whole fucking shaft.

Josh
So I'm changing the prop shaft of my vehicle.

Josh
Based on based on cost?

Ben
You're not changing.

Josh
What would you normally do though like what would the process normally be? So I'm trying to understand like when this happened.

Ben
They just they just get replaced.

Josh
Oh, and you replace them, but they're just ridiculous expenses.

Ben
Yeah, and there's only one in the country.

Josh
Yea..uhmm, and this this other method is this ah, safe, obviously?

Ben
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all fully balanced there, the proper prop shop place. But what they'll do is instead of it being a non serviceable prop shop, it'll become a serviceable prop shop.

Josh
Yeah, I know. It sounds even better.

Ben
Yeah, yeah. It'll be a stronger prop shop, so you'll get a better product for that one. for less money, essentially. But then it's serviceable because you're supposed to. You're supposed to change those out every 60,000 which is insane.

Josh
No, it sounds insane.

Ben
Yeah. So it's like, well with a better bearing and better prop shaft it, it will run nicer and it will be stronger. So you can run potentially more power through the the transmition

Josh
Yeah. And then what do you?

Ben
To do, but it's just future proofing it

Josh
What's the time and and, and money on on that and availability and all the rest on on that and probability?

Ben
I I don't know, I'm just giving the heads up

Josh
Absolutely. Yeah. It's just.

Ben
Like I don't want to just...ha yea

Josh
Yeah. All right, well, let's ah What? What's, what's the freaking what? Yeah, that's yeah. What's What's the prop shaft worth?

Ben
You sat down?

Josh
What's the prop shop worth yea

Ben
Right. I get the fucking quote up So the retail price was 3 and a half grand. Yeah, and the my price... is... 2924 and 30 cents.

Josh
That's an expensive part.

Ben
It's a very expensive part, which is why I'm going to suggest you get the prop shaft that you currently have, fixed. Because that will be a lot cheaper than that.

Josh
Yeah...

Ben
Damn.. I did, the guy at ah, VW got back to me today, he goes, 'I just have to double check the price on that part because it was a bit up there', I was like 'yeah', And he goes, 'yeah, it's this much.' I'm like, that's actually ridiculous, That's that's an actual ridiculous price for what it is. It's a, it's a piece of metal tube, Yeah.

Josh
Yeah.

Ben
Damm, um, let me cont, Theres a place in  kunda park that does drive shafts thats all they do

Josh
Yeah.

Ben
So I just want to give them a call and just see if I can get, if I give it like... the car's all driving and everything, I've got like a basic tune in it so that it can be driven. And I just need to... I'll probably need to get it over to them so that they can have a look at it...see if they can actually fix it, yeah.

Josh
Yeah, what's actually? What's it doing 'cause I never had it, I didn't notice anything.

Ben
You wouldn't notice anything. It's 'cause it's... so the drive shaft has to come out to get the exhaust out. the the catalyic converter in it has to come out and that drive shaft has to come out. But they're prone to... the second that you disturb them, at all, the bearings inside it will fall out.. potentially, and then they just become unusable...from the slightest little knock. So it's like there's nothing... Nothing would have shown signs of it being worn before whilst it in, The second that you basically touch it, it can break. Which is ridiculous because its a prop shaft.

Josh
......Yeah...um from, is that, from what you're saying then, that you took it out and then that happened?

Ben
Uh,  Yeah, no, the...it.. So the it, no, I haven't broken it. Is that what you're trying to say?

Josh
I was trying to come to the conclusion that you were saying. I wasn't piecing it together...

Ben
So..They, break.. they don't break... The the bearings come apart when they are disturbed, but they have to be, just like that part has to come out for the exhaust to go in. There's no other way to get that exhaust into the car without that prop shaft coming out, that prop shaft only comes out one way, which is down.  so it was, it's taken out with all care I even got it on camera.. with me taking it out.. Everything was done correctly. Uhm.. It's just, the...as soon as it's released the pressure off both sides of it... The bearings have just let go. Which is.. it's just the bearing, thats.. You can't even see the bearings, they're inside it so.

Josh
Yeah. Alright..

Ben
So I'm gonna have to get a price on seeing if it can be fixed and then we'll just go from there.

Josh
Yes cheers that'd be appreciated.

Ben
Sweet, I'll ring around now and I'll give you a shout back.

Josh
Thanks Ben
